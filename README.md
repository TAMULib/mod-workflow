## Introduction

This module provides a **Workflow** backend **FOLIO** module intended to help facilite and interact with one or more **Workflow Engines**.
A **Workflow Engine** is able to react to events generated in FOLIO and may also trigger events based on some schedule.
**Triggering Events** may be data flows or user interactions.

This module is de-coupled from the **Workflow Engine**.
A **Workflow Engine**, such as [mod-camunda](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-camunda/), provides the **Business Process Model and Notation** (**BPMN**) and performs the actual execution of a **Workflow**.

## Additional information

The [Workflow Documentation](docs/README.md) describes additional information on particular standards and other topics.
